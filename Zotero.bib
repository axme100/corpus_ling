	abstract = {Situations of sustained language contact between Spanish and English have existed in the United States since the early nineteenth century. Initial contact between these two languages in what is now the U.S. Southwest was the result of territorial expansion by English-speaking settlers. Later contact situations in New York and Florida were caused by economic and political circumstances facing Spanish-speaking caribeños. As a result of this contact, English has exerted some degree of influence on the bilingual Spanish spoken in the United States. The structural results of contact range from subtle changes in articulation to broad changes in the lexicon, all of which have been studied to greater and lesser extents by linguists over the past century. This introduction provides a point of reference for these studies. The accumulation of structural influences from English, regardless of geographical location, is leading to a transformation in the linguistic structure of U.S. Spanish, thereby making it distinct from other varieties of this language.},

	abstract = {Demographic data indicate that the English of Mexican Americans is destined to play a key role in the sociolinguistic study of language variation in the United States. In fact, Mexican American speakers are reported to account for more than 12.5\% of the U.S. population. In 2003, the U.S. Census released data showing that Latinos and Latinas had replaced African Americans as the largest minority ethnic group in the U.S., and by 2007, 29.2 million Americans listed their ancestry as Mexican (Pew Hispanic Center, 2009). Moreover, in addition to the large numbers of Mexicans (first generation) and Mexican Americans (second generation) living in the Southwest, we are now seeing a new representation of these ethnic groups in other areas, such as the South. For example, between 1990 and 2000, North Carolina experienced a higher percentage of growth in its Mexican American population than any other state (Wolfram, Carter \& Moriello, 2004).
These statistics are important with respect to language because they reveal that a large and increasing population of English speakers in the U.S. are Latinos and Latinas of Mexican origin. Our notion of American English, then, must be extended to include the variety traditionally spoken by the children of Mexican immigrants in the U.S., generally referred to in the literature as Chicano English. In addition, if we look at the Mexican American population as a whole, we will find a number of other varieties of English spoken. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

	abstract = {This project examines vowels in hiatus across word boundaries in Spanish. Our findings are based on a corpus of seven female speakers of the Veracruz variety of Mexican Spanish. Previous research on vowel transitions has proposed several possible outcomes for vowel combinations across word boundaries in Spanish: hiatus, diphthong, reduction or deletion of one vowel, or creation of a new vowel. The purpose of this project was to investigate the conditions under which these outcomes actually occur in running speech using spectrographic analysis. In terms of hiatus, our results support those of a study conducted on the Spanish of northern New Mexico/Southern Colorado by Alba (2006), which concluded that maintaining hiatus was not the preferred outcome. Likewise, in the present study, 94\% of our 148 tokens showed non-maintenance of hiatus. Our data did not clearly reveal a single preferred outcome among the non-maintenance tokens, but rather a mixture of tendencies. These varied widely by vowel combination and speaker. Another surprising outcome that deserves attention is centralization. Centralization was present in all four vowel combinations, occurring more frequently than anticipated, given that it is thought not to occur in Spanish. Adapted from the source document},

The current study empirically tests Varela's claims of English transfer in the Spanish vowel system of three generations of Miami-Cuban bilinguals. Speech is analyzed acoustically with Praat and vowel formant values (F1 and F2) are normalized with NORM. No evidence of English vowels replacing Spanish vowels is discovered but the existence of vowel centralization of unstressed vowels in Miami-Cuban Spanish is confirmed. The current study discusses the stability of the Miami-Cuban Spanish vowel system as compared to Spanish in general.},

The corpus statistics for each transcription level are also presented. A set of phonetic rules describing phonetic context observed empirically in spontaneous conversation is also validated with the transcription. The corpus has been used for the construction of acoustic models and a phonetic dictionary for the construction of a speech recognition system.

The current study presents the first quantitative, acoustic, variationist investigation of the linguistic and social factors that constrain aspiration (as measured by VOT) in Yucatan Spanish. Analyses, conducted using mixed-effects statistical models, indicate that VOT values are longer in stressed syllables and phrase initially, and also before non-low vowels. Regarding social factors, men consistently favor longer VOT, along with older speakers. While no significant result was obtained based on language background (Maya-Spanish bilinguals vs. Spanish monolinguals), there is evidence of the influence of language and dialect contact on the observed patterns. Further results and conclusions are discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

The chapter emphasizes that the process of chunking along with categorization leads to the creation of constructions.

	abstract = {This article investigates the linguistic and social constraints on final nasal variation in Yucatan Spanish (YS), based on data collected in Merida, Yucatan. Absolute final nasals in YS may surface variably as: [n], [ŋ], ø or [m] (e.g. pan → [pám], ‘bread’). The results reveal a distribution of final nasal realization unique to YS, as well as detail its patterning throughout the community. Unlike some previous findings, the data under investigation here demonstrate [n] to be the preferred nasal variant, accounting for 60\% of tokens. Regional variant [m] accounts for 25\%, while [ŋ] and ø were infrequent variants, arising 8\% and 5\% of the time, respectively. Standard [n] occurs mostly among older speakers and Spanish monolinguals. Bilabial [m], however, is a recent innovation, led by younger speakers, women, and Mayan-Spanish bilinguals. The realization [m] may serve as a marker of regional identity for some speakers. For others, though, this variant is becoming a linguistic stereotype, as suggested by qualitative data from speaker comments and instances of [m] in the popular culture, including on internet websites.

	abstract = {While the vocalic system in Spanish is typically described as stable, there is increasing evidence for dialectal vowel variation. The focus of the current study is variable vowel raising in rural Michoacan Spanish, which involves the mid vowels, /e/ and /o/, in unstressed post-tonic positions and their variable realizations as [e, i] or [o, u], respectively. In this dissertation, I perform a sociophonetic study of this variable process using acoustic information about the formant values of the relevant vowels and I examine the influence of different linguistic and social factors on this phenomenon. Previous studies on unstressed vowel raising mainly focus on Puerto Rico (Holmquist 1998, 2005 and Oliver Rajan 2007, 2008). Several studies mention that vowel raising occurs in Mexico, but none offer a thorough description of the process. My dissertation focuses on the variation in mid vowel realizations found in the Spanish spoken in Colongo, Michoacan, Mexico, and it is the first systematic description of vowel raising in the region.As for the independent variables, I look at linguistic factors that have been shown to influence raising in other dialects such as the tonic vowel, preceding consonant, following sound, stress pattern, and whether the vowel is in an open or closed syllable, among others. The analysis of these factors allows us to examine the relation between vowel raising and another vocalic process present in Mexican Spanish, namely unstressed vowel devoicing (UVD), by which unstressed vowels become devoiced or reduced in their duration. In this dissertation, I propose that both of these processes are cases of vowel weakening and I provide evidence to support this claim. Given this Weakening Hypothesis, I expect vowel raising to occur in the same, weak positions where UVD occurs, namely in closed syllables and utterance-finally, and my results support this idea. As part of the Weakening Hypothesis, I also propose that weakening will lead to an increase in coarticulatory effects, which are more likely in contexts where there is reduction in duration (Browman and Goldstein 1989, 1992). Thus, I expect to see these coarticulatory effects from both preceding and following sounds in addition to effects from the tonic vowel, and my results find this to be true as well.The social factors of age, education level, occupation, and mobility, since they are highly correlated, are used in an analysis of social networks to look at social differences within the community. I create a numerical index incorporating these factors that ultimately results in the division between an open or closed social network. I expect less vowel raising in the open social network, where participants have more access to interactions outside of Colongo, and more vowel raising in the closed social network, where participants have less outside influence, and my results confirm this hypothesis. The division into social networks helps us to better understand the social differences among the community members and the effect of these differences on vowel production.},

	abstract = {The variation between labial and velar fricatives ([f] {\textgreater} [x], e.g. [x]uego fuego 'fire,' [x]umar fumar 'to smoke') frequently occurs in disparate Spanish dialects (from Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, El Salvador, New Mexico, among others) (Quilis 1993) and it is found in first language acquisition (Eblen 1982 and Greenlee 1992). The change [f] {\textgreater} [x] or [x] {\textgreater} [f] has also been observed in other languages such as English, Diola, Chinese, Tuareg, Hausa, among others (Foulkes 1997). Although the variation between [f] and [x] is so common cross-linguistically, there is no adequate understanding of the linguistic and social motivations that affect it. Using the variationist sociolinguistics framework (Labov 1972 and Weinreich, Labov \& Herzog 1968), this study analyzes the variation of such fricatives in the speech of 25 native speakers of Corrientes (Argentine) Spanish. Results indicate that two main factors affect [f] {\textgreater} [x] variation in Spanish: i) phonetic context and ii) literacy (or lack of formal education). [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

	abstract = {Fricative /f/ aspiration (i. e., /f/ -{\textgreater} [h] in words such as afuera 'outside' and fui 'went.1sg') is a nonstandard rural feature of Spanish that occurs in a Pacific Northwest speech community of migrant farmworkers of Mexican descent. While the historical change in Spanish from /f/ {\textgreater} [h] has an extensive literature (see Naro 1972; Penny 1990; Pensado 1993; Torreblanca 1984), the social and linguistic factors that condition the variable's synchronic use are poorly understood (Renaud 2014). This study examines the current trajectory of /f/ aspiration in the context of migration in the U.S., utilizing sociolinguistic interviews conducted with 28 participants ranging in age from 17 to 71, born in either Mexico or the U.S. The study demonstrates that speakers who are more tightly integrated into local family and agriculture networks are more likely to produce [h]. A significant interaction between gender and age is also found: while women of all ages are sensitive to the standard variant and use less of the stigmatized variant [h] overall, young men are robust producers of [h]. It is suggested that this variant holds covert prestige among men of Mexican descent working in agriculture in the migrant setting of the Pacific Northwest. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

	abstract = {This paper argues for a focus on the social meaning of variation, based in a study of stylistic practice. It is common in the study of variation to interpret variables as reflections of speakers' membership in social categories. Others have argued more recently that variables are associated not with the categories themselves, but with stances and characteristics that constitute those categories. The paper reviews some variation studies that show that variables do not have static meanings, but rather general meanings that become more specific in the context of styles. Building on Michael Silverstein's notion of indexical order, I argue that the meanings of variables are not precise or fixed but rather constitute a field of potential meanings – an indexical field, or constellation of ideologically related meanings, any one of which can be activated in the situated use of the variable. The field is fluid, and each new activation has the potential to change the field by building on ideological connections. Thus variation constitutes an indexical system that embeds ideology in language and that is in turn part and parcel of the construction of ideology.},
